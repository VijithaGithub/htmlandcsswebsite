        <p class="container" >Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the <span class="container1">ecosphere</span> or the <span class="container1">universe</span> as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the <span class="container1">laws</span>, elements and <span class="container1">phenomena </span>of the physical world, including <span class="container1">life</span>. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright <span class="container1">separate and even superior to nature</span>.</p>
